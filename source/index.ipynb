    "The subject of our study, Awale is an ancient, two player board game originating from Ghana.\n",
    "This game is also sometimes called Awele, Oware, Owari or Ayo in the neighboring countries, languages and cultures :cite:`crane1982`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, the game is played on the ground, by digging two rows of six small pits, each containing\n",
    "stones, seeds or shells. In the present document, we will name them seeds. The game is also often played on a wooden board symbolizing the original dirt pits.\n",
    "The board can be schematized as in :numref:`Figure %s <fig:initial_board>`, every big circle representing a pit and every small disc representing a seed.\n",
    "Numbers at the bottom right of each pit are the counts of seeds in each pit for better readability.\n",
    "Each row of pits is owned by a player that sits in front of it (:numref:`see Fig. %s <board>`).\n",
    "For the sake of convenience, the players are named North and South.\n",
    "The 6 pits from the top row belong to North and the 6 from the bottom to South.\n",
    "\n",
    "The players take turns, a player removing all the seeds from a pit and placing them in other pits following the rules. This is called sowing the seeds. This can result in a configuration in which the player is allowed to capture some seeds according to the rules.\n",
    "The goal for each player is to capture more seeds than his opponent.\n",
    "The rules vary slightly across countries and will be detailed in :ref:`sec:rules`. "

    "\n",
    "Like Awale, Mancala games can consist of rows of pits, some of them having more than two rows (:numref:`see Fig. %s <bao>`) and sometimes extra pits with a special role. Mancala games can sometimes be played by more than two players.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mancala games in general, while less known than Chess or Go, are quite popular and\n",

    "We now have a way to determine if an agent is stronger than another but we don't have a way to order all our agents regarding to their strength. In the following, we prove that a total order between all agents does not exist by showing that the relation of strength between two agents is not transitive.\n",

    "Lets define 3 theoretical algorithms: each of them play the first move at random and the next moves of the match depending on the first move in three different ways: always playing the best move (noted :math:`+`), never playing the best move (noted :math:`-`) or playing at random (noted :math:`r`).\n",
