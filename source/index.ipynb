    "Awale is a popular board game played mainly in Africa. The board has two rows of six pits, each containing four seeds in the initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each turn, the players move some seeds and can potentially capture some of them, according to deterministic rules. The goal of the game is to capture more seeds than one's opponent.\n",

    "In Section 5, we describe more advanced versions of MCTS and in particular UCT.\n",
    "Section 6 presents some empirical results (simulations) allowing to compare several MCTS algorithms and Section 7 concludes."

    "The subject of our study, Awale is an ancient, two player board game originating from Ghana.\n",
    "This game is also sometimes called Awele, Oware, Owari or Ayo in the neighboring countries, languages and cultures :cite:`crane1982`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, the game is played on the ground, by digging two rows of six small pits, each containing\n",
    "stones, seeds or shells. In the present document, we will name them seeds. The game is also often played on a wooden board symbolizing the original dirt pits.\n",
    "The board can be schematized as in :numref:`Figure %s <fig:initial_board>`, every big circle representing a pit and every small disc representing a seed.\n",
    "Numbers at the bottom right of each pit are the counts of seeds in each pit for better readability.\n",
    "Each row of pits is owned by a player that sits in front of it (:numref:`see Fig. %s <board>`).\n",
    "For the sake of convenience, the players are named North and South.\n",
    "The 6 pits from the top row belong to North and the 6 from the bottom to South.\n",
    "\n",
    "The players take turns, a player removing all the seeds from a pit and placing them in other pits following the rules. This is called sowing the seeds. This can result in a configuration in which the player is allowed to capture some seeds according to the rules.\n",
    "The goal for each player is to capture more seeds than his opponent.\n",
    "The rules vary slightly across countries and will be detailed in :ref:`sec:rules`. "

    "\n",
    "Like Awale, Mancala games can consist of rows of pits, some of them having more than two rows (:numref:`see Fig. %s <bao>`) and sometimes extra pits with a special role. Mancala games can sometimes be played by more than two players.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mancala games in general, while less known than Chess or Go, are quite popular and\n",

    "We wish to compare algorithms A and B. The probability that A wins is denoted by :math:`p` and is unknown (the probability that B wins is :math:`1-p`). Our null hypothesis is that :math:`p=0.50` and the alternative hypothesis is that :math:`p \\neq 0.50`. To compare algorithms A and B, we run :math:`N` simulations and A wins :math:`n` times (thus B wins :math:`N-n` times). Using the Python function xxx, we then compute the p-value. If it is lower than :math:`5\\%`, we traditionally reject the null hypothesis. This guarantees that, conditional on H0 being true, the probability of making an incorrect decision is :math:`5\\%`. But if H1 is true, the probability of an incorrect decision is not necessarily :math:`5\\%`: it depends on the number :math:`N` of simulations and on the true value of :math:`p`. To ensure that the probability of an incorrect decision, conditional on H1, be acceptable, we resort to the concept of statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the true probability p is :math:`0.75`. This is very far from the null hypothesis. In that case, we want the probability of choosing H1 (not making an incorrect decision) to be high (for instance :math:`95\\%`). This probability is the power and can be computed by means of the R function powerBinom implemented in the R package exactci:\n",
