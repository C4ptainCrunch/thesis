    "The subject of our study, Awale is an ancient, two player board game originating from Ghana.\n",
    "This game is also sometimes called Awele, Oware, Owari or Ayo in the neighboring countries, languages and cultures :cite:`crane1982`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, the game is played on the ground, by digging two rows of six small pits, each containing\n",
    "stones, seeds or shells. In the present document, we will name them seeds. The game is also often played on a wooden board symbolizing the original dirt pits.\n",
    "The board can be schematized as in :numref:`Figure %s <fig:initial_board>`, every big circle representing a pit and every small disc representing a seed.\n",
    "Numbers at the bottom right of each pit are the counts of seeds in each pit for better readability.\n",
    "Each row of pits is owned by a player that sits in front of it (:numref:`see Figure %s <board>`).\n",
    "For the sake of convenience, the players are named North and South.\n",
    "The 6 pits from the top row belong to North and the 6 from the bottom to South.\n",
    "\n",
    "The players take turns, a player removing all the seeds from a pit and placing them in other pits following the rules. This is called sowing the seeds. This can result in a configuration in which the player is allowed to capture some seeds according to the rules.\n",
    "The goal for each player is to capture more seeds than his opponent.\n",
    "The rules vary slightly across countries and will be detailed in Section (:ref:`sec:rules`). "

    "\n",
    "Like Awale, Mancala games can consist of rows of pits, some of them having more than two rows (:numref:`see Figure %s <bao>`) and sometimes extra pits with a special role. Mancala games can sometimes be played by more than two players.\n",

    "Mancala games in general, while less known than Chess or Go, are quite popular and\n",

    "Because the outcome of a match between two agents is not deterministic, we can not rely on a single match to ascertain than the winner of a match is better than the looser. So the first step is to define a statistical method to compare two arbitrarily chosen agents: A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that A wins is denoted by :math:`p` and is unknown (the probability that B wins is :math:`1-p`).\n",
    "Our null hypothesis is that both agents are equaly strong (:math:`p=0.50`) and the alternative hypothesis is that they are of different strength (:math:`p \\neq 0.50`).\n",
    "To compare agents A and B, we run :math:`N` matches and A wins :math:`n` times (thus B wins :math:`N-n` times).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the SciPy function :code:`scipy.stats.binom_test`, we then compute the p-value.\n",
    "If it is lower than :math:`5\\%`, we traditionally reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "This guarantees that, conditional on H0 being true, the probability of making an incorrect decision is :math:`5\\%`.\n",
    "But if H1 is true, the probability of an incorrect decision is not necessarily :math:`5\\%`: it depends on the number :math:`N` of matches and on the true value of :math:`p`.\n",
    "To ensure that the probability of an incorrect decision, conditional on H1, be acceptable, we resort to the concept of statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the true probability :math:`p` is :math:`0.75`. This is very far from the null hypothesis. In that case, we want the probability of choosing H1 (not making an incorrect decision) to be high (for instance :math:`95\\%`). This probability is the power and can be computed by means of the R function :code:`powerBinom` implemented in the R package :code:`exactci`. The output of this function is the number :math:`N` of matches needed to achieve the desired power and it is 49. As we always play a even number of matches between two agents (A vs. B and B vs. A), we decide that we need :math:`N=50` matches.\n",

    "Now that we know the number of matches we need to play to be able to assertain that H1 is probable enough, we still need to know how many matches of the 50 an agent needs to win so we may declare H1 true. This can be done with the :code:`scipy.stats.binom_test` function."

    "We have 6 algorithms, each with some continuous or discrete parameters. Even if we restrict every parameter to a small finite set of values (let's say 100), we would still have 600 agents to compare. This would in turn make a tournament of size :math:`600^2` where each evaluation of the relation requires 50 matches. This method would thus require :math:`600^2 * 50 = 18\\,000\\,000` matches. Playing such a big number of matches is hardly feasible so we will resort to a more frugal approach.\n",

This will in turn reduce the number of agents playing in the tournament to 6 and the number of matches to play to :math:`6^2 * 50 = 180`, a much more reasonable number. While this approach reduces drastically the amount of computations needed, it might not be perfect.\n",
    "We have no guarantee that the champion whithin a family (all agents derived from a single algorithm) is also the best family member against agents from other families. This is a known limitation and verifying this assumption is outside of the scope of this work.  \n",

    "We make the assumption that with :math:`n` big enough, :math:`f_n(A_{x}, A_{y})` is smooth for all :math:`x,y \\in X` due to the fact that both agents :math:`A_{x}` and :math:`A_{y}` share the same algorithm. This smoothness property will be empirically confirmed later (see XXX and XXX).\n",
