    "Many algorithms have been proposed and studied to play sequential\n",

    "A few examples are :math:`\\alpha-\\beta` pruning, Minimax,\n",
    "Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and Alpha (Go) Zero :cite:`AlphaGoZero`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on MCTS as it does not require any expert knowledge\n",
    "about the given game to make reasonable decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of MCTS is simple : we represent the starting state of a game by\n",
    "the root node of a tree. This node then has a children for each possible action\n",
    "the current player can make. The n-th child of the node represents the state in\n",
    "which the game would be if the payer had played the n-th possible action.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum number of children of a node in the game is called the branching\n",
    "factor. In a classical Awalé game the player can choose to sow his seeds from\n",
    "one of his non-empty pits. As the player has 6 pits, the branching factor is 6\n",
    "(this is very small compared to branching factor of 19 from the game of Go and\n",
    "makes Awalé much easier to play with this method).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this representation, if we build the complete tree, we will have computed\n",
    "every possible state in the game and every leaf of the tree will be a final\n",
