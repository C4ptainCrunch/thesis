    "This game is also sometimes called Oware, Owari or Ayo in the neighouring countries, languages and cultures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, the game is played on the ground, by digging two rows of six small pits, each containing\n",
    "stones, seeds or shells. In the present document, we will name them seeds. The game is also often played on a wooden board symbolizing the original dirt pits.\n",
    "The board can be schematized as in Fig. XXX, every big circle representing a pit and every small disc representing a seed.\n",
    "Numbers at the bottom right of each pit are the counts of seeds in each pit for better readability.\n",
    "Each row of pits is owned by a player that sits in front of it (:numref:`see Fig. %s <intro-kalah>`).\n",
    "For the sake of convenience, the players are named North and South.   \n",
    "The 6 pits from the top row belong to North and the 6 from the bottom to South.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is played turn by turn, a player taking all the seeds from a pit and placing them in others following the rules. This is called sowing the seeds. The resulting configuration of the board might result in the player being allowed by the rules to capture some seeds.\n",
    "The goal for each player is to capture more seeds than his opponent."

    "Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and Alpha (Go) Zero :cite:`AlphaGoZero`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on MCTS as it does not require any expert knowledge\n",
    "about the given game to make reasonable decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of MCTS is simple : we represent the initial state of a game by\n",
    "the root node of a tree. This node then has a child for each possible action\n",
    "the current player can make. The n-th child of the node represents the state in\n",
    "which the game would be if the player played the n-th possible action.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum number of children of a node in the game is called the branching\n",
    "factor. In a classical Awale game the player can choose to sow his seeds from\n",
    "one of his non-empty pits. As the player has 6 pits, the branching factor is 6\n",
    "(this is very small compared to the branching factor of 19 for the game of Go and\n",
    "makes Awale much easier to play with MCTS).\n",
    "\n",

    "computationally impossible for games with a high branching factor (unless very shallow).\n",
